      "content": "It's a good tool for low budgets player will wanted to try the skin for their own risk, but there's something missing for it to become 5 star. if it's possible for the Heroes Events skin can also change, like literally every skin on a hero can change. example: Layla - Miss Hikari to (Other skin, like legend, basic, starlight... etc,) You get the point . Also, a little advance update, like now. The spongebob collab skin for gloo to Patrick, and Cyclop to spongebob. I'll appreciate this alot",
